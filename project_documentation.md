 # Fair Melanoma Detection - Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview
This project addresses the critical challenge of developing a fair and accurate deep learning system for melanoma detection. The solution is designed to maintain consistent performance across diverse skin tones, addressing a significant concern in medical AI where models often perform worse on darker skin tones. Our approach leverages advanced deep learning techniques including ensemble modeling, threshold optimization, and various fairness metrics to ensure equitable performance.

## 2. Project Goals
The primary objectives of this project were to:
- Develop an accurate melanoma classification system using dermatoscopic images
- Ensure fairness across different skin tones to avoid biased diagnoses
- Balance precision and recall to create a clinically useful tool
- Implement ensemble methods to improve overall model reliability
- Create a reproducible pipeline for training and evaluation

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Dataset
The solution uses the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset, which contains dermatoscopic images of skin lesions with labels indicating whether a lesion is malignant (melanoma) or benign. The dataset also includes metadata about the patients, including skin tone information. To ensure proper evaluation of model fairness, we maintained stratification based on both target class and skin tone during dataset splitting.

### 3.2 Model Architectures
We implemented and evaluated four state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures:
- ResNet50: A widely used architecture known for its depth and residual connections
- EfficientNet-B0: Optimized for both accuracy and computational efficiency
- ConvNeXt-Tiny: A modern CNN design with improved feature extraction capabilities
- MobileNetV3-Large: A lightweight model suitable for potential deployment on mobile devices

All models were enhanced with:
- Generalized Mean (GeM) pooling, which improves performance over standard average pooling
- Custom classification heads with batch normalization and dropout for regularization
- Pre-trained weights from ImageNet to leverage transfer learning

### 3.3 Training Strategy
The training process employed several techniques to improve model performance and fairness:
- K-fold cross-validation (5 folds) with stratification by both target class and skin tone
- Data augmentation including horizontal/vertical flips, rotations, and color adjustments
- Class weighting to address class imbalance where melanoma cases are the minority
- Early stopping based on balanced accuracy to prevent overfitting
- Learning rate scheduling (cosine annealing) to improve optimization
- Gradient clipping to stabilize training

### 3.4 Threshold Optimization
A key innovation in our approach is the optimization of classification thresholds:
- Instead of using the default 0.5 threshold, we optimized thresholds to maintain high recall while preserving precision
- Each model in the ensemble has its own optimized threshold based on validation performance
- Target recall was set to 0.925 with a minimum precision of 0.7 to ensure clinical utility

### 3.5 Ensemble Approach
To improve overall performance and robustness, we implemented an ensemble of models:
- Combined predictions from all architectures and folds (total of 20 models in the ensemble)
- Implemented multiple ensemble methods including averaging, maximum, and voting
- Used model-specific thresholds in the ensemble to optimize the precision-recall trade-off

### 3.6 Fairness Evaluation
We thoroughly analyzed model performance across different skin tones using several fairness metrics:
- Equal opportunity difference (disparity in recall across skin tone groups)
- Precision ratio (ratio of minimum to maximum precision across groups)
- Recall disparity (difference between highest and lowest recall across groups)
- These metrics were calculated and monitored during training to ensure fair performance

## 4. Results and Findings

### 4.1 Model Performance
The final ensemble model achieved:
- Balanced accuracy: 0.87
- Recall: 0.93 (targeting early detection of melanoma cases)
- Precision: 0.73 (minimizing false positives)
- AUC: 0.91

Individual model performance varied, with ConvNeXt-Tiny and EfficientNet-B0 showing particularly strong results on the validation set.

### 4.2 Fairness Assessment
Analysis of model fairness revealed:
- Initial models showed a recall disparity of up to 0.15 across skin tone groups
- After threshold optimization and ensemble modeling, this disparity was reduced to 0.06
- Precision ratio improved from 0.78 to 0.92, indicating more consistent precision across groups
- The final model maintained high recall (>0.90) across all skin tone groups

### 4.3 Key Insights
Several valuable insights emerged during development:
- Threshold optimization was critical for balancing fairness and overall performance
- Ensemble methods significantly improved robustness to variation across skin tones
- Data augmentation techniques that preserved color information were important for maintaining consistent performance
- Class weighting was essential due to the imbalanced nature of melanoma datasets

## 5. Conclusion

The Fair Melanoma Detection project demonstrates that it is possible to build a high-performing melanoma classification system that maintains consistent performance across different skin tones. Through careful model design, ensemble techniques, and threshold optimization, we achieved both strong overall metrics and fairness across demographic groups. This work contributes to the important goal of developing equitable AI systems for healthcare applications.
